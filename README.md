# Linguistic Sensitivity Upgrade: AI-Enabled Normalization of Offensive Text

## Abstract

The rapid growth of social media and online communication platforms has led to an increase in the occurrence of offensive and inappropriate language, posing challenges to maintaining a respectful and inclusive online environment. This work presents a novel system for normalizing offensive text using a state-of-the-art language model, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The proposed system aims to automatically detect and normalize offensive language in text, thereby contributing to a more civil and respectful online discourse. The primary focus is on converting offensive text into its non-offensive counterparts while preserving the original context and meaning. This study introduces a novel system leveraging the BERT model to automatically detect and normalize offensive language in text. By fine-tuning BERT on a diverse dataset of offensive text, the system identifies offensive content and replaces it with contextually appropriate alternatives, fostering a more respectful and inclusive online communication. The proposed system's efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations, with the potential for seamless integration into various online platforms to mitigate the impact of offensive language and promote constructive digital interactions.

## Existing System

This study focuses on the utilization of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for the binary classification task of offensive language detection. In the realm of online communication, the rapid proliferation of offensive content necessitates efficient mechanisms to determine whether a given sentence contains offensive language. Leveraging the capabilities of BERT, a state-of-the-art language model, this research delves into the effectiveness of existing models specifically designed for this purpose. The approach involves training the BERT model on a comprehensive dataset comprising offensive and non-offensive sentences, enabling the model to learn intricate linguistic nuances indicative of offensive language. The model's pre-trained contextual embeddings enable it to capture subtle semantic cues, contributing to its ability to discern offensive content within a given sentence accurately.

## Proposed System

The proposed system integrates BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to identify potentially offensive language within a given text. To achieve this, BERT's contextual embeddings are employed, enabling the system to comprehend the nuances and contextual implications of words within the text. Once offensive language is identified, the system initiates a process of generating various combinations with the goal of eliminating the offensive words. This combination generation process involves systematically altering the offensive word while retaining the sentence's syntactic and semantic structure. By substituting the offensive word with synonyms, antonyms, or contextually relevant alternatives, the system explores multiple linguistic possibilities. Each combination is assessed against its context and meaning, ensuring that the resulting sentence remains coherent and conveys the intended message accurately.
